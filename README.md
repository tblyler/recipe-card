# recipe-card
WIP (but fully functional) and extremely messy at the moment.

## Quick Start
Use the Google Docs recipe template to for your recipes.

Have scans of jpegs by your docx files, and have your docx/images in folders specific to that recipe.

One docx file and as many jpeg images as you want. The image in the recipe tempalte will also be used.

Just `go get github.com/tblyler/recipe-card` and run `recipe-card`.

Run with `--help` for options.
